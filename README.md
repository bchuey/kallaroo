## Mission: 

One of the biggest hurdles independent contractors face is finding new clients. In most cases, the contractor does not have the marketing dollars or the time to be their own sales team. 

We hope to alleviate some of that burden with Kallaroo.

Kallaroo creates a digital bridge in real-time between independent contractors and prospective clients.

## How It Works:

Mary has a plumbing problem with her kitchen sink but she does not have the time to go research different plumbers. 

So Mary will go login to her Kallaroo account, create a new 'task' and wait for the bids to roll in.

Paul (the plumber) is alerted of this new task in the area. He reads the description of what is needed and submits his bid.

Mary sees all the bids from vetted plumbers in the area, and decides she likes Paul the best. She accepts the bid.

Paul is then alerted on his device with the location of the clogged pipes. Paul goes to Mary's house and fixes the kitchen sink. 

The two verify the job is completed and money is transferred digitally. Mary is a happy customer.

Well done Paul!
